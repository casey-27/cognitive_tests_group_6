This test measures the ability to quickly detect which side of two dot arrays (presented as an image) has more dots as quicly and as accurately as possible. The dot arrays are presented for 0.75s on a fixation cross, after which only the fixation cross remains on the screen for 3s, followed by a pause of 1.5s before the next image is shown. Consent must be given before the test starts, and the results are uploaded onto a google form.

V2.O.O updates:
-Functions are stored in a Python code file (ANS_test_v2.py) and is imported into Notebook (ANS_test_V2.0.0.ipynb) to run test
-Google environment created 
-Images made bigger (width=450)
-Change the position of the consent form code cell integrating it in the last cell, more user friedly 
-Add more images by making test run quicker, by removing time.sleep() from blank image
-HTML function imporoved by making test more user frienly, providing enough time to go through instructions and enter required data 
-User results (scores and time taken to the complete test) are compared to mean results from previous responses 
-Comparison of results is visualised through a scatter plot
