# Memory Test Code (Group 6)

This test starts by asking for some information from the respondent for data analysis. 
The test itself has 3 levels in total, in increasing difficulty.
For each level, the respondent will have 15 seconds to observe a picture.
After 15 seconds, they will then have to answer 5 questions about the picture.
Once all 3 levels are completed, they are asked to provide consent for uploading their data to our repository.
